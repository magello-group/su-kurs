Final Training
--------------

We will now try to tie everything together. You will work in the course-ec2-client project
and create a complex integration project involving 3 external services joining them together
into a complete solution.

See the file course-ec2-client/src/main/java/se/r2m/training/CamelDemoClientRouteBuilder.java
for instructions on how to set up the external services.
